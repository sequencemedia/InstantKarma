# InstantKarma
Karma-Mocha-Chai-Sinon with Gulp

Recipes for Instant Karma in AMD and CommonJS.

For AMD, use the folder ```amd```.

For CommonJS, use the folder ```cjs```.

```
npm install
npm start
```

InstantKarma assumes your JS application can be found in ```client/app```.

You can correct that assumption by modifying ```karma.conf.js``` and ```gulp.conf.js``` with the paths used in your application.

Sample modules and sample module specs are included for Angular and ordinary JS applications.
