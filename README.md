# InstantKarma
Karma-Mocha-Chai-Sinon with Gulp

```
npm install
npm start
```

InstantKarma assumes your client-side JS application can be found in ```client/app``` and your server-side JS application can be found in ```server/app```.

You can correct that assumption by modifying ```karma.conf.js``` and ```gulp.conf.js``` with the paths used in your application.
